# host-miRNAs-vs-coronaviruses

Source code which allows to fully reproduce results presented in the preprint https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.184846.

- predict_miRNA_targets.py: intersect the results of miRDB and TargetScan predictions;
- analyze_diff_expr.py: summary of differential expression analysis done for mouse lung miRNA-seq data;
- analyze_binding_sites.py: find miR-21-3p binding sites shared across coronaviruses;
- analyze_MSA.py: analyze multiple sequence alignment to assess conservativity of miR-21-3p binding sites.
